# URL-downloader

Project Description:
The URL Downloader is a simple Python application that allows users to download files from the internet by providing a URL. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it user-friendly and accessible for individuals who may not be familiar with command-line tools.

Key Features:
URL Input: Users can enter the URL of the file they wish to download.
Filename Input: Users can specify the name they want to give to the downloaded file.
Destination Path Selection: Users can select a directory where the downloaded file will be saved.
File Downloading: The application fetches the file from the specified URL and saves it to the chosen location on the user's device.
User-Friendly Interface: The GUI makes it easy for users to interact with the application without needing programming knowledge.

Prerequisites:
Before running the URL Downloader application, ensure you have the following:
Python: Make sure Python is installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.x).
Requests Library: This library is used for making HTTP requests to download files. You can install it using pip:
pip install requests
Tkinter: This library is included with standard Python installations, but if you're using a minimal installation, you might need to install it separately.

Required Libraries:
The following libraries are utilized in this project:
requests: This library is used to make HTTP requests and handle file downloads.
tkinter: This module is used for creating the GUI of the application.
tkinter.filedialog: This submodule provides functions to open file dialog boxes for selecting directories.

Conclusion:
The URL Downloader project is a straightforward tool that simplifies downloading files from URLs by providing an intuitive graphical interface. Users can easily input their desired URL and specify where they want their files saved without needing any technical expertise. This application serves as an excellent example of how Python can be used for practical tasks while leveraging libraries like Tkinter for GUI development and Requests for web interactions.
